<br>
<p>I'm Pravallika, a 2nd year Computer Science Engineering student with a deep passion for technology, creativity, and community service. I love writing code, exploring tech innovations, and finding ways to contribute to society and the environment.</p>
<p>I’m particularly interested in software development, generative AI, and using technology to solve problems. My creative side comes alive through writing, art and crafting. I've participated in various social and literary events, always aiming to inspire and make a difference.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m learning Java, Python, DSA and DBMS while honing my programming skills. I’m eager to take on new challenges, keep learning and contribute positively to the world around me.</p>
<p>
Let’s connect if you’re passionate about technology, community service or creative collaborations! I'm sure that together we can make our world a better place to live.</p>
